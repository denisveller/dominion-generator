# dominion-generator v5.0
This website generates a list of dominion cards, to expidite game set up. 
It supports the expansions that I own. more will be added if I buy more expansions. 
Optimized to look good on mobile only because that's my usecase.
5.0 rewrites the internal logic again, as much of an improvement over 4.0 as 4.0 was over 3.0.
